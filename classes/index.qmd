## Course Overview

> [!info] Telling Stories with Data **in Python**
>
> This course is designed around Rowan Alexander's [-@alexander2023telling] book *Telling Stories with Data*. Rowan's book uses the language R, which is a great choice for quantitative researchers. However, we will use Python in this course, which is also a great choice for quantitative researchers.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course,

1. first

To help you get there, each class has a more specific set of learning objectives. You can find them at the start of each of the class pages linked in the left-hand sidebar.

### Atomic Habits and the Mundanity of Excellence

> Excellence is mundane. Superlative performance is really a confluence of dozens of small skills or activities, each one learned or stumbled upon, which have been carefully drilled into habit and then are fitted together in a synthesized whole. There is nothing extraordinary or super-human in any one of those actions; only the fact that they are done consistently and correctly, and all together, produce excellence.

The best way to get good at quantitative social science -- and data science more generally -- is to develop good **atomic habits** [@barrett2021data].
